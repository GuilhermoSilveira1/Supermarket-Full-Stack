# Full-stack Supermarket Supervision System

### Objective
This project builds upon the Java Supermarket system with the goal of learning key concepts and technologies during its development. The main focus is on **React.js**, **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, **API** integration, and **database** connectivity. I might also explore **Next.js** for enhanced integration.

### Accomplished So Far
- Created a complete page using plain **JavaScript**, with additional pages built in **HTML** and basic **CSS**.
- Decided to switch to **React** for a better user experience and a more suitable tool for the projectâ€™s goals.
- Almost finished a basic **React** course, and have started working on pages and basic components.

### Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Java
- **Frontend:** React
- **Request Protocols:** HTTP or HTTPS
- **Database:** MySQL
- **API:** To be determined and developed
